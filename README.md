Overview

Finance Tracker is a mobile application developed using React Native, designed to assist users in managing their financial transactions efficiently. Users can easily track their recent transactions, perform various financial operations such as sending money, receiving funds, managing loans, and topping up accounts. The app also offers a seamless experience with support for both light and dark themes.

Features

Home Screen: Displays the user's profile information, quick access to financial operations (Send, Receive, Loan, Topup), and a list of recent transactions. It includes navigation to the Settings screen and a toggle switch for switching between light and dark themes.

Settings Screen: Offers users a range of options such as language selection, profile management, contact support, password modification, and access to the privacy policy. It features a toggle switch to easily switch between light and dark themes.

Navigation: Utilizes React Navigation to enable smooth navigation between the Home and Settings screens.

Dark Mode Implementation: Implements a state variable isDarkMode to manage the current theme. Components are styled conditionally based on the isDarkMode state to ensure an optimal user experience in both light and dark themes.

Styles

Styling is defined using StyleSheet.create and dynamically applied based on the isDarkMode state to maintain consistency across the application's interface.

This revised version maintains clarity and conciseness while ensuring all key features and functionalities are effectively communicated.
